## Overview

PALS is a full-stack web application that delivers an animated, multi-screen English **tenses** assessment experience. Learners sign in with Google, work through a diagnostic and a practice quiz drawn from a 12-tense question bank, and receive a personalized learning profile. While they answer, PALS records detailed per-question **behaviour telemetry** (timing, hint usage, answer changes, confidence, focus loss).

That telemetry powers an **adaptive ML pipeline**: per-topic features are aggregated and sent to a hosted **Hugging Face** model that predicts the learner's proficiency level and recommends the next topic/difficulty. Results — quiz attempts, ML predictions, learning paths, and topic profiles — are persisted to **Firebase Data Connect** (Cloud SQL) through the backend, while the raw session is archived to **Google Drive / Sheets** for research. The dashboard then reads back the learner's stats (average score, quizzes taken, daily streak) from the backend.

The project is split into two parts:

- **`frontend/`** — React 19 + Vite single-page app (the learner experience + ML pipeline orchestration).
- **`backend/`** — Express 5 API that verifies Firebase ID tokens, persists quiz/prediction data to Firebase Data Connect, and serves user statistics.

---

## Features

- **Google Sign-In** — Authentication via Firebase Authentication (Google popup); the ID token is verified server-side by the backend.
- **Diagnostic Assessment** — A 12-question diagnostic covering the major English tenses, with 3 progressive hint levels per question.
- **Practice Quiz** — A 12-question follow-up session with previous/next navigation and a quick-access question panel.
- **Behaviour Telemetry** — Per-question tracking of duration, visit count, hint read time, max hint unlocked, answer-change sequence, confidence (first/final), struggle indicators, and window focus loss.
- **Confidence Picker** — After each answer the learner rates how sure they are (*Yakin* / *Ragu-ragu*), feeding the confidence telemetry.
- **Adaptive ML Prediction** — Per-topic features (accuracy, hint usage, overthinking, timing, confidence) are aggregated and sent to a hosted **Hugging Face** model that predicts the learner's level and confidence, then recommends the next topic/difficulty.
- **Data Persistence (Cloud SQL)** — Quiz attempts, ML predictions, learning paths, and 12-topic profiles are saved to **Firebase Data Connect** via the backend.
- **Research Data Collection** — Each raw session is archived to **Google Drive / Sheets** through a Google Apps Script endpoint.
- **Dashboard Stats** — Average score, quizzes taken, and a daily **streak** are computed server-side from the user's quiz history.
- **Learning Style Detection** — Classifies users based on response time and hint usage, and generates accuracy, average response time, strengths, growth areas, and recommendations.
- **Score Completion** — Animated SVG arc score with canvas-confetti celebration.

## Screen Flow

```
Login (Google) → Diagnostic Intro → Diagnostic Quiz (12 questions)
              → Analyzing → Learning Profile → Dashboard
              → Practice Quiz (12 questions) → Quiz Complete → Dashboard
```

---

## Question Bank

Questions are generated from the *PALS PIJAK capstone* dataset and cover **12 English tenses** with **15 questions each (5 easy / 5 medium / 5 hard)** — 180 questions in total. The diagnostic and practice quizzes each draw 12 questions across the tenses.

Exports from `frontend/src/data/questions.js`:

| Export                | Description                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `diagnosticQuestions` | 12-question diagnostic set                   |
| `practiceQuestions`   | 12-question practice set                     |
| `questionsByTense`    | Full bank grouped by tense (12 × 15)         |
| `allQuestions`        | Flat list of every question in the bank      |

Each question carries `questionId`, `topic`, `difficulty`/`difficultyLabel`, `idealDuration`, `answer`, and three Indonesian `hints`.

---

## Behaviour Telemetry

`useQuizTelemetry` (in `frontend/src/lib/telemetry.js`) records one summary row per question:

| Column                                | Meaning                                         |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `total_duration_sec`                  | Total time spent on the question                |
| `visit_count`                         | How many times the question was visited         |
| `final_is_correct`                    | Whether the final answer was correct            |
| `final_is_ideal_duration`             | Answered within the question's ideal time       |
| `max_hint_unlocked`                   | Highest hint level opened (0–3)                 |
| `total_hint_read_sec`                 | Time spent with hints visible                   |
| `first_confidence` / `final_confidence` | Confidence rating (yakin / ragu)              |
| `total_answer_changes`                | Number of distinct answer switches              |
| `ever_selected_correct_answer`        | Correct option was selected at some point       |
| `changed_mind_after_correct`          | Switched away after choosing the correct option |
| `focus_loss_total`                    | Times the window lost focus                     |

Data is stored under the `pals_telemetry` key in `localStorage`, then aggregated per topic and fed into the ML pipeline (see below). `telemetry.js` also exposes `telemetryToCSV()` for ad-hoc export.

---

## ML & Data Pipeline

After a quiz finishes, the `Analyzing` screen orchestrates the pipeline in `frontend/src/lib/api.js`:

1. **`preprocessTelemetryForML(records)`** — groups the flat telemetry rows by topic and computes per-topic mean features: `acc_topik`, `hint_topik`, `overthink_topik`, `time_topik`, `conf_topik`.
2. **`sendToHuggingFace(payloads)`** — fires a parallel `POST` per topic to the hosted Hugging Face model, returning the predicted level + confidence.
3. **`sendToGoogleDrive(sessionId, records)`** — archives the raw session to Google Sheets/Drive via a Google Apps Script endpoint.
4. **`saveQuizToBackend(payload)`** — `POST /api/quiz/submit` (Bearer token) to persist the attempt, prediction, and learning path to Firebase Data Connect.
5. **`fetchUserStats()`** — `GET /api/user/stats` to read back diagnostic status and dashboard stats.

The Hugging Face and Google Apps Script endpoints are configured at the top of `api.js`; the backend base URL comes from `VITE_API_URL` (default `http://localhost:3000`).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm
- A Firebase project with **Authentication → Google** enabled

### 1. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

The Firebase **client** config lives in `frontend/src/firebase.js`. Update it to point at your own Firebase project if needed.

To point the frontend at a non-local backend, set `VITE_API_URL` (e.g. in `frontend/.env`):

```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.example.com
```

### 2. Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start          # http://localhost:3000
```

The backend verifies Firebase ID tokens and persists data to Firebase Data Connect, so it needs a **service account key** from the *same* Firebase project the frontend uses:

1. Firebase Console → ⚙️ **Project Settings → Service accounts → Generate new private key**.
2. Save it as `backend/config/serviceAccountKey.json`.

It also relies on **Firebase Data Connect** (Cloud SQL). The schema and queries live under `backend/dataconnect/`, and the generated admin SDK under `backend/src/dataconnect-admin-generated/`. Provision Data Connect for your project (see `backend/firebase.json` / `.firebaserc`) before submitting quizzes.

> `serviceAccountKey.json`, `node_modules/`, and `.env` are git-ignored and must never be committed.

### Build for Production

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## API

All authenticated endpoints expect an `Authorization: Bearer <Firebase idToken>` header.

| Method | Endpoint           | Auth   | Description                                                                 |
| ------ | ------------------ | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/`                | —      | Health check (`PALS Backend Running`)                                      |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/login`  | Bearer | Verifies the Firebase ID token and returns the decoded user                |
| `POST` | `/api/quiz/submit` | Bearer | Persists a quiz attempt, ML prediction, learning path, and topic profile   |
| `GET`  | `/api/user/stats`  | Bearer | Returns diagnostic status and dashboard stats (average score, count, streak) |
